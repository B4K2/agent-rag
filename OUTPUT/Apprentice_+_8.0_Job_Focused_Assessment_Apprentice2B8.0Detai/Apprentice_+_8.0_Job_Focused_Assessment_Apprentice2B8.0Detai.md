This report is confidential and its contents are intended to assist in the prediction of an applicant's work behaviour. Please note that the assessment components included in this solution report are not weighted equally. Some of the components are broad measures of

behaviour and some are more narrow. Competencies denoted by an asterisk (\*) are measures of

narrow behaviours. While these behaviours are important to the overall score, they are not weighted as heavily when compared to other components in this solution. Our research indicates this weighting best predicts job performance. If you would like more information about this report (including scoring) or other products that SHL offers, please contact your
